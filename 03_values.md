# Phase 2: Values

**Source:** Keeney, R.L. — *Value-Focused Thinking: A Path to Creative Decisionmaking*

Traditional DA is alternative-focused: given these options, which is best? Keeney argues we should be *value-focused*: first understand what matters, then seek or create alternatives that deliver it.

---

## Purpose

Identify what the decision maker truly cares about — the objectives and values that will guide evaluation of alternatives.

---

## Core Principle

> "Alternatives are means to achieve values. Values are the reason for the decision."  
> — Ralph Keeney

## Values Elicitation Checklist

### A. Identify Objectives

- [ ] **Ask "What do you want to achieve?"**
  - Not "What do you want to do?" (that's alternatives)
  
- [ ] **Ask "Why does this decision matter?"**
  - Probes for deeper values
  
- [ ] **Ask "What would a good outcome look like?"**
  - Concrete descriptions of success
  
- [ ] **Ask "What would you regret?"**
  - Reveals values through their absence

### B. Build the Objectives Hierarchy

**Fundamental Objectives** — Ultimate ends (what we truly care about)  
**Means Objectives** — Intermediate goals (valued because they lead to ends)

- [ ] **Test each objective: "Why is this important?"**
  - If answer is "because it leads to X" → means objective
  - If answer is "it just is" or "it's what we ultimately want" → fundamental
  
- [ ] **Organize into hierarchy**
  - Higher-level strategic objectives
  - Lower-level specific objectives
  
- [ ] **Ensure completeness**
  - Are all important dimensions covered?
  - Check against common categories: financial, environmental, social, technical, risk

### C. Define Attributes

For each fundamental objective:

- [ ] **Choose measurable attributes**
  - Natural: direct measures (e.g., cost in dollars)
  - Constructed: custom scales when natural measures don't exist
  - Proxy: indirect measures when direct isn't feasible
  
- [ ] **Define scales and ranges**
  - What's the best plausible level?
  - What's the worst acceptable level?

### D. Understand Trade-offs

- [ ] **Preliminary trade-off exploration**
  - Which objectives might conflict?
  - How much of X would you give up for Y?
  
- [ ] **Identify "must have" vs. "nice to have"**
  - Constraints vs. preferences

## Common Categories of Values

Consider whether these apply to your decision:

| Category | Example Objectives |
|----------|-------------------|
| Financial | Minimize cost, maximize return |
| Environmental | Reduce emissions, protect biodiversity |
| Social | Improve livelihoods, ensure equity |
| Technical | Ensure reliability, maintain quality |
| Risk | Minimize downside, ensure resilience |
| Time | Meet deadlines, minimize delays |
| Relationships | Maintain trust, build partnerships |

## Value-Focused Thinking for Alternatives

Once values are clear:

- [ ] **Generate alternatives that explicitly target values**
  - "What actions would best achieve Objective X?"
  
- [ ] **Look for creative alternatives**
  - Values reveal what we want — now find new ways to get it
  
- [ ] **Identify dominated alternatives early**
  - If an option is worse on all values, eliminate it

---

## Outputs

1. **Objectives Hierarchy** — Organized list of fundamental and means objectives
2. **Value Tree** — Visual representation of objectives and sub-objectives
3. **Attribute Definitions** — How each objective will be measured
4. **Preliminary Trade-off Notes** — Initial understanding of conflicts

---

## Quality Check

Before proceeding to Alternatives (Phase 3):

- [ ] Decision maker confirms objectives reflect their values
- [ ] All stakeholder concerns are represented in objectives
- [ ] No major value dimensions missing
- [ ] Attributes are defined and measurable

---

## Transition to Alternatives

With values clarified → generate and evaluate alternatives (Phase 3)
