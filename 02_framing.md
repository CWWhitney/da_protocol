# Phase 1: Framing

**Source:** Howard, R.A. & Abbas, A.E. — *Foundations of Decision Analysis*

Framing is the most critical phase. A well-framed decision is half-solved; a poorly framed decision cannot be saved by sophisticated analysis.

---

## Purpose

Define what decision is being made, for whom, and within what boundaries.

---

## Framing Checklist

### A. Decision Statement

- [ ] **Write a clear decision statement**
  - Action-oriented: "Decide whether to..." or "Choose among..."
  - Specific enough to act on
  - Not a question, not a problem statement
  
- [ ] **Test the statement**
  - Would a reasonable person understand what's being decided?
  - Does it suggest what alternatives might look like?

**Template:**  
> "The [decision maker] must decide [action/choice] by [timeframe] in order to [purpose/objective]."

### B. Decision Context

- [ ] **Why is this decision needed now?**
  - Triggering event or opportunity
  
- [ ] **What happens if no decision is made?**
  - Status quo consequences
  - Is "do nothing" a viable alternative?
  
- [ ] **What are the key uncertainties?**
  - What don't we know that matters?
  
- [ ] **What are the key constraints?**
  - Budget, time, regulations, organizational limits

### C. Scope Refinement

- [ ] **Confirm boundaries from pre-framing**
  - In-scope decisions
  - Out-of-scope (explicit exclusions)
  
- [ ] **Identify linked decisions**
  - What decisions must precede this one?
  - What decisions follow from this one?
  
- [ ] **Set the time horizon**
  - Over what period will consequences unfold?
  - When must the decision be made?

### D. Initial Stakeholder Engagement

- [ ] **Confirm decision maker's frame**
  - Does the decision maker agree with the decision statement?
  
- [ ] **Identify frame conflicts**
  - Do stakeholders see the decision differently?
  - Address conflicts before proceeding

## Common Framing Errors

❌ **Too broad:** "Decide how to improve the organization"  
❌ **Too narrow:** Artificially limiting alternatives  
❌ **Problem statement, not decision:** "We have a budget problem"  
❌ **Predetermined answer:** "Decide to implement X"  
❌ **Multiple decisions bundled:** Conflating separate choices  

---

## Framing Outputs

1. **Decision Statement** — Clear, concise, actionable
2. **Context Document** — Background, trigger, constraints
3. **Scope Definition** — Boundaries, exclusions, linked decisions
4. **Stakeholder Confirmation** — Agreement on the frame

---

## Quality Check

Before proceeding to Values (Phase 2):

- [ ] Decision statement reviewed and approved by decision maker
- [ ] All key stakeholders understand the frame
- [ ] No unresolved frame conflicts
- [ ] Scope is stable and documented

---

## Transition to Values

With frame established → proceed to identify what matters (Phase 2: Values)
