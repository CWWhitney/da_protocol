Scientific Writing Style Guide

A practical guide for clear, honest, and effective scientific communication.
Based on Strunk & White's Elements of Style, Nature journal guidelines, and scientific writing best practices.

Last Updated: February 2026


Core Principle

Clarity and honesty in communication. Every word should serve a purpose. Every claim should be accurate and properly supported.


Formatting Standards

Headers and sections
- Use sentence case for all headers
- Correct: "Research methodology"
- Incorrect: "RESEARCH METHODOLOGY" or "Research Methodology"
- Keep headers descriptive and simple
- Avoid decorative formatting (boxes, excessive symbols, ASCII art)

Text formatting
- Plain text is preferred over heavy formatting
- Use bullets for unordered lists, numbers only when sequence matters
- Maintain consistent spacing throughout documents
- Avoid excessive whitespace or decorative elements
- Use italics sparingly for emphasis or technical terms (not bold or underline)

Tables and figures
- Label all tables and figures clearly
- Include descriptive captions
- Reference in text before they appear
- Keep formatting simple and consistent


Writing Clarity: Strunk & White Principles

Omit needless words
- Every word should contribute meaning
- "The question as to whether" → "Whether"
- "There is no doubt but that" → "Doubtless"
- "Used for fuel purposes" → "Used for fuel"
- "In order to" → "To"
- "For the purpose of" → "For" or "To"
- "Owing to the fact that" → "Because" or "Since"
- "In spite of the fact that" → "Although" or "Though"
- "Call your attention to the fact that" → "Remind you" or "Notify you"
- "The fact that" can almost always be deleted

Use active voice
- Preferred: "We measured temperature daily"
- Avoid: "Temperature was measured daily"
- Active voice is more direct, vigorous, and easier to read
- Exception: Passive voice is acceptable when the actor is unknown, unimportant, or when emphasizing the action over the actor

Make definite assertions
- Avoid timid or evasive language
- "It is believed that" → "We believe" or state the belief directly
- "It is interesting to note" → Delete and state the interesting fact
- Exception: Genuine uncertainty should be acknowledged appropriately

Put statements in positive form
- "Did not remember" → "Forgot"
- "Did not pay attention to" → "Ignored"
- "Did not have much confidence in" → "Distrusted"
- Positive form is more direct and usually more concise

Use specific, concrete language
- Prefer concrete terms to vague abstractions
- "A period of unfavorable weather set in" → "It rained for a week"
- "The experiment was completed" → "We completed the experiment on March 15"


Scientific Writing Standards

Precision and accuracy
- Use precise, unambiguous language
- Define all technical terms on first use
- Spell out abbreviations on first use, then use abbreviation consistently
- Avoid ambiguous pronouns (this, that, it) without clear antecedents
- Specify what "this" or "that" refers to: "This result shows..." not just "This shows..."
- Be quantitative when possible: "increased by 50%" not "increased substantially"

Numbers and statistics
- Spell out numbers one through nine
- Use numerals for 10 and above
- Always use numerals for: measurements, percentages, ages, page numbers, dates, times
- Use commas in large numbers: 1,000 or 10,000 (not 1000 or 10000)
- Percentages: 5% or 23% (not five percent)
- Ranges: 20-30 or 20–30 (be consistent)
- Report statistics with appropriate precision (usually 2-3 significant figures)

Units and measurements
- Use standard SI units consistently
- Include units with all measurements
- Use spaces between number and unit: 5 kg (not 5kg)
- Use superscripts properly: m² or m^2

Tense usage
- Abstract: past or present tense
- Introduction: present tense for established knowledge
- Methods: past tense (what you did)
- Results: past tense (what you found)
- Discussion: present tense for conclusions, past tense for specific results
- Be consistent within each section


Citations and Academic Integrity

Citation accuracy
- Only cite papers for claims they actually make
- Verify citations before including them in your work
- Read at least the abstract of every paper you cite
- Preferably read the full paper
- Check that the cited paper actually supports your specific claim
- Incorrect: Citing a general review paper to support a specific finding it doesn't contain
- Correct: Citing the original research paper that reports the finding

Citation format
- Follow your field's standard citation format consistently
- In-text citations: (Author Year) or (Author et al. Year) for three or more authors
- Direct quotes require page numbers
- Multiple citations in chronological order, separated by semicolons
- Keep your reference list complete and properly formatted

Distinguishing knowledge types
Always clearly distinguish between:

Established knowledge
- Supported by peer-reviewed literature
- "Participatory approaches improve adoption outcomes (Smith 2020)"
- Cite appropriately with verified references

Research hypotheses
- Clearly label as hypotheses, not facts
- "We hypothesize that X affects Y"
- "This study investigates whether..."
- Never present your research question as if the answer is already known

Preliminary findings
- Mark as tentative or preliminary
- "Initial results suggest..."
- "Early data indicate..."
- "Preliminary analysis shows..."

Research gaps
- What is not yet known or documented
- "Despite extensive research on X, we lack understanding of Y"
- "The relationship between A and B remains poorly documented"

Common citation errors to avoid
- Citing papers you haven't read
- Citing papers that don't support your claim
- Presenting hypotheses as established facts
- Claiming "studies show" when they don't
- Missing citations for factual claims
- Over-citing (every sentence doesn't need citations)
- Under-citing (failure to credit others' work)


Clear Scientific Communication

Avoid jargon when possible
- Write for intelligent non-specialists when you can
- Use technical terms when necessary for precision
- Define all jargon on first use
- Consider whether a simpler word would work: "use" instead of "utilize"

Paragraph structure
- One main idea per paragraph
- Topic sentence states the paragraph's main point
- Supporting sentences develop that point
- Concluding sentence when needed for complex paragraphs
- Connect paragraphs logically with transitions

Logical flow
- Present information in logical order
- Use parallel structure for related ideas
- Connect ideas explicitly
- Guide the reader through your reasoning
- Use transitions appropriately (however, therefore, moreover) but don't overuse them

Sentence variety
- Vary sentence length and structure
- Short sentences for emphasis
- Longer sentences for complex ideas
- Avoid strings of very short or very long sentences
- Read aloud to check rhythm and flow


Common Writing Errors to Avoid

Wordiness
- "Due to the fact that" → "Because"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"
- "In the event that" → "If"
- "Despite the fact that" → "Although"
- "At the present time" → "Currently" or "Now"
- "In regards to" / "With respect to" → "About" or "Regarding"
- "A majority of" → "Most"
- "A number of" → "Several" or "Many"

Nominalizations (turning verbs into nouns)
- "Reached a conclusion" → "Concluded"
- "Made a decision" → "Decided"
- "Gave consideration to" → "Considered"
- "Conducted an investigation" → "Investigated"

Redundancies
- "Past history" → "History"
- "Future plans" → "Plans"
- "End result" → "Result"
- "Completely eliminate" → "Eliminate"
- "Absolutely essential" → "Essential"

Weak qualifiers (use sparingly)
- Very, rather, quite, pretty (usually add nothing)
- "Very important" → "Important" or "Critical"
- "Quite significant" → "Significant"
- Exception: Technical qualifiers are necessary ("statistically significant")

Vague language
- "A lot of" → Specify the amount
- "Recently" → Give the date or timeframe
- "Some researchers" → Which researchers? Cite them
- "It is believed that" → Who believes it? Cite sources or use "We believe"

□ Would a non-specialist understand the main points?

Accuracy
□ Have I verified all citations?
□ Does each citation support the specific claim?
□ Are all numbers and statistics correct?
□ Have I avoided overstating findings?
□ Are units and measurements consistent?

Format
□ Are all headers in sentence case?
□ Is formatting minimal and consistent?
□ Are figures and tables properly labeled?
□ Is the reference list complete and formatted correctly?

Style

Common Peer Review Comments (and How to Avoid Them)

"Unclear what the main finding is"
→ State your main finding clearly in the abstract and conclusion

"Insufficient detail in methods"
→ Provide enough detail for replication

"Results and discussion are mixed"
→ Keep these sections separate; report findings in Results, interpret them in Discussion

"Overclaiming or overstating results"
→ Be conservative in your conclusions; acknowledge limitations

"Missing relevant citations"
→ Conduct thorough literature review; cite previous work fairly

"Writing is unclear or wordy"
→ Revise for clarity; omit needless words

"Figures are unclear or poorly labeled"
→ Make figures self-explanatory with clear labels and captions

Final Thoughts

Good scientific writing requires practice. The goal is not perfect prose, but clear communication of your research. When in doubt:

- Choose clarity over complexity
- Choose simplicity over sophistication
- Choose accuracy over assertion
- Choose honesty over hype

Remember: You are not writing to impress, but to inform. Your reader's time is valuable. Make your point clearly, support it adequately, and move on.

The best scientific writing is invisible—the reader focuses on the science, not the writing. That is the goal.
