# Phase 0: Pre-Framing

**Source:** Ellen Coopersmith, Decision Frameworks

Pre-framing addresses the often-overlooked stage *before* formal decision analysis begins. Many DA efforts fail not because of poor analysis, but because the organization or team wasn't ready to make a decision.

## Purpose

Ensure alignment, readiness, and commitment before investing in formal analysis.

## Pre-Framing Checklist

### A. Decision Readiness

- [ ] **Is there actually a decision to be made?**
  - Not every problem requires a decision — some need information, some need action, some need acceptance
  
- [ ] **Is this the right time?**
  - Too early: insufficient information or premature constraints
  - Too late: options already foreclosed
  
- [ ] **Who is the decision maker?**
  - Clearly identified individual or body with authority to commit resources
  - Not a committee without decision rights

### B. Stakeholder Alignment

- [ ] **Are key stakeholders identified?**
  - Decision maker
  - Technical experts
  - Those affected by the decision
  - Those who must implement
  
- [ ] **Is there agreement that a decision is needed?**
  - Shared recognition of the problem/opportunity
  
- [ ] **Are stakeholders willing to act on analysis results?**
  - Pre-commitment to follow the process
  - Understanding that analysis may recommend uncomfortable options

### C. Scope Boundaries

- [ ] **What is in scope?**
  - Clear boundaries on what the decision covers
  
- [ ] **What is explicitly out of scope?**
  - Constraints, sacred cows, non-negotiables
  
- [ ] **Are the boundaries stable?**
  - Risk of scope creep or changing constraints mid-analysis

### D. Resources & Commitment

- [ ] **Is there time for proper analysis?**
  - Rushed analysis often worse than no analysis
  
- [ ] **Are resources available?**
  - Analyst time, stakeholder time, data access
  
- [ ] **Is there commitment to the process?**
  - Not just "do some analysis" but genuine engagement

## Red Flags (Do Not Proceed)

⚠️ No clear decision maker identified  
⚠️ Decision already made — analysis is theater  
⚠️ Key stakeholders opposed to the process  
⚠️ Insufficient time or resources  
⚠️ Scope is undefined or constantly shifting

## Pre-Framing Outputs

1. **Decision Readiness Assessment** — Go / No-Go / Defer
2. **Stakeholder Map** — Who's involved, their roles, their concerns
3. **Preliminary Scope Statement** — What's in, what's out
4. **Process Agreement** — Commitment from decision maker to proceed

## Transition to Framing

When pre-framing checklist is satisfied → proceed to formal framing (Phase 1)

If not satisfied:
- Address gaps before proceeding
- OR explicitly document risks of proceeding anyway
- OR defer the analysis until conditions improve
